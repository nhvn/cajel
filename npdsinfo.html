                    <h2>NPDS Cyberinfrastructure</h2>
                    <p>NPDS is a "who what where" diristry-registry-directory system for identifying, describing, locating and linking things on the internet, web and grid. PORTAL registries identify resources with unique labels and lexical tags in a manner compatible with the lexical web. DOORS directories specify locations and semantic descriptions for these identified resources in a manner compatible with the semantic web. PORTAL registries and DOORS directories were designed to be analogous to IRIS registries and DNS directories. This original design has been enhanced with Nexus diristries to provide integrated services combining the functions of both PORTAL registries and DOORS directories.
                        For comprehensive reports on the NPDS cyberinfrastructure, refer to the original design proposed in DOORS to the Semantic Web and Grid With a PORTAL for Biomedical Computing published online 3 August 2007 in the journal IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine and the revised design described in A Distributed Infrastructure for Metadata about Metadata: The HDMM Architectural Style and PORTAL-DOORS System published online 1 June 2010 in the journal Future Internet. More recent information can be found in the documents available at NPDS Site Papers. These reports contain explanations of the principles, concepts, models, schemas, URL and querystring designs used by PDP for NPDS.</p>
                    <h2>PDP-DREAM Principles</h2>
                    <p>The principles for the PORTAL-DOORS Project (PDP) were first proposed and described by Taswell in 2006 as the foundation for work on PDP and the Nexus-PORTAL-DOORS-Scribe (NPDS) cyberinfrastructure. This work on PDP and NPDS has been continuously available since 2007 from a publicly accessible web site at www.PORTALDOORS.org. The 2006 PDP principles were renamed the 2019 DREAM principles in DREAM Principles and FAIR Metrics from the PORTAL-DOORS Project for the Semantic Web with the acronym DREAM for "Discoverable Data with Reproducible Results for Equivalent Entities with Accessible Attributes and Manageable Metadata". These PDP-DREAM principles have been discussed further in the 2019 Managing Scientific Literature with Software from the PORTAL-DOORS Project, the 2020 DREAM Principles from the PORTAL-DOORS Project and NPDS Cyberinfrastructure, and the 2020 Hitchhiker's Guide to Scholarly Research Integrity.</p>
                    <h2>PDP-DREAM Software</h2>
                    <p>PDP-DREAM software provides anonymous user read access to resource metadata in the Nexus diristries, PORTAL registries and DOORS directories as well as information on the continuing design, development, and implementation of NPDS as a cyberinfrastructure for semantic computing on the internet, web, and grid. Scribe registrar services are maintained at the following sites for resource metadata and data management at Nexus diristries, PORTAL registries and DOORS directories:

                        BHA Registrar for BrainWatch, Eywa, Gaia, HELPME, and SOLOMON diristries supported by Brain Health Alliance
                        GTG Registrar for BioPORT, CTGaming, GeneScene, ManRay, and Osler diristries supported by Global TeleGenetics
                        PDP Registrar for Avicenna, Beacon, DaVinci, Knuth, and Socrates diristries supported by the PORTAL-DOORS Project
                        NPDS Registrar for the NPDS network system root supported by the PORTAL-DOORS Project
                        all of which require secure https connection for authorized agent write access. Resource metadata record agents with Author and/or Editor roles may access write privileges at the BHA, GTG and PDP Scribe Registrars, but not for management of NPDS components where write access is restricted to agents with Admin roles.</p>
